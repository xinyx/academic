隐私保护手段

1. Access control
1.1 Discretionary access control (DAC)
        owner decide
1.2 Mandatory access control (MAC)
        level of trust
1.3 Role-based access control (RBAC)
        system decide a role which is a set of permission, then asign a user a role
1.4 Purposed-based access control (PBAC) 
        system determine which purpose the resources can be accessed for
        
2. Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P)
    W3C develops 
    browsers collect information based on its policy against users' policy
    limitation: not enforcing
    
3. Hippocratic Databases
    uses some privacy metadata tables

4. Anonymity
    k-anonymity using generalization and suppression
    
5. A Life-Cycle Policy (LCP) Model
    deterministic finite automato
    
    
实现：
    [policy binder] close or even in Context Acquisition Devices
        associate sensed context with corresponding user-defined LCP, regulating its life cycle.
    [policy compiler] at the Component
        translates the LCP policy into a language
    [component] 
        managing the context life cycle following the LCP

MultiUse
privacy-enabled, alse privacy-enforced
    should prevent from changing LCPs => cryptography or secure hardware
prevent continuously query in order to obtaon all accurate history
distrubution:
    event broadcast. difficult and reveal info.
Querying Multi-Accuracy Data 
One-Way Data Degradation vs. Dynamic Computation
Static vs. Dynamic Life-Cycle Models
